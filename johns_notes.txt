## 1. Making the tests pass
I had trouble getting the phpunit to run as it couldn't find the autoload.php file.
(Not sure if I had something wrong there, but for the sake of completing the exercise I added another path at phpunit line 38.)
Apart from that this section is working nicely and passing all tests.

## 2. Refactoring

--moved the database display formated strings out of the function definitions to improve readability
--removed some arbitrary blank lines
--made the style of braces consistent 

## 3. Testing

I added tests for all the public methods in the class. As they are all simple getters, there wasn't much to this.
